# Windows-batch-file
This batch file is just a fun file lol
There are 6 options to the batch file:
1. Matrix
2. Tree the C: drive (You look like a hacker with this one!)
3. Opens https://adf.ly/ (IDK why)
4. Opens a new cmd window (Pretty useful)
5. Open a roblox tab in default browser
6. Closes the batch file
